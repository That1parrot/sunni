            <h2>Calamity of Thursday: In Depth Analysis</h2>
            <p>The Calamity of Thursday (Raziyyat al-Khamis) is an event that occurred in the final days of the Prophet Muhammad’s (ﷺ) life. According to Sahih al-Bukhari and Sahih Muslim, the Prophet (ﷺ), while suffering from severe illness, requested writing materials to record something that would prevent people from going astray. However, a dispute broke out among those present, leading the Prophet (ﷺ) to dismiss them and not proceed with writing. This event has been a source of controversy, with Shia scholars claiming that Umar ibn al-Khattab (RA) prevented the Prophet (ﷺ) from appointing Ali (RA) as his successor.</p>
            
            <h3>Did Umar (RA) Prevent the Prophet (ﷺ) From Writing?</h3>
            <p>One of the most common Shia assertions is that Umar (RA) deliberately blocked the Prophet (ﷺ) from recording his final will. The argument is based on Umar’s statement: “The Book of Allah is sufficient for us.” This, according to Shia scholars, was an attempt to prevent the Prophet (ﷺ) from formally declaring Ali (RA) as his successor. But does this claim hold any weight?</p>
            <p>First, nowhere in the hadith does it explicitly state that Umar (RA) prevented the Prophet (ﷺ) from writing. The hadith simply mentions that a dispute arose among the people in the room. This was not an act of individual defiance but rather a discussion among the Sahaba. Some were eager to bring writing materials, while others, seeing the Prophet (ﷺ) in intense pain, questioned whether this was necessary at that moment.
            </p>Second, the Prophet (ﷺ) himself decided to dismiss the gathering. If this was a matter of divine necessity, nothing could have stopped the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) from completing his mission. This is a crucial point: the Prophet (ﷺ) was divinely protected from being silenced or hindered in delivering revelation. To suggest that Umar (RA) could obstruct him is to undermine the role of prophethood and divine decree.</p>
            </p>Furthermore, if the Prophet (ﷺ) had truly intended to appoint Ali (RA) through a written document, he had ample opportunity to do so in the three days following this incident. Why did he never repeat the request? The simplest answer is that whatever he intended to say had already been conveyed through his teachings, actions, and public statements. For example there are many hadiths that clarify one thing if you never let go of it would prevent people from going astray was the Quran. And when Umar ibn al-Khattab stated “The Book of Allah is sufficient for us.” Rasulullah ﷺ could have just assumed that the people understood his message based on that response.</p>

            
            <h3>Did Umar (RA) Call the Prophet (ﷺ) Delirious?</h3>
            <p>Another major argument used by Shias is that Umar (RA) allegedly insulted the Prophet (ﷺ) by saying he was delirious (yahjur). This claim is misleading, and a proper examination of the narrations refutes this accusation entirely.</p>
            <p>The actual text of the hadith states that some people in the gathering questioned, “Is he delirious?” The hadith does not specify that this was said by Umar (RA). Instead, it describes a general disagreement among the people present. Shia scholars, however, insist that this was a statement made by Umar (RA), even though the narration does not support this claim. </p>
            <p>Even if someone in the room questioned the Prophet’s state, this would not mean they were rejecting his prophethood. Prophets, including Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ), can experience intense physical illness. Prophet Ayub (AS) was afflicted with severe disease, yet his status as a prophet remained intact. Questioning whether someone in distress is in a condition to dictate important instructions is not an act of disbelief but a matter of concern for their well-being.</p>
            <p>Additionally, the Prophet (ﷺ) did not rebuke Umar (RA). If Umar (RA) had actually done something wrong, the Prophet (ﷺ) would have corrected him immediately. Instead, the Prophet (ﷺ) told the people to leave, expressing frustration at their quarrel rather than at a specific individual.</p>

            <h3>Why the Shia Narrative is Flawed</h3>
            <p>A critical flaw in the Shia argument is that it suggests that Islam’s leadership structure was incomplete until the Prophet (ﷺ) wrote this supposed will. This contradicts Surah Al-Ma’idah (5:3):</p>
            <p></p>
            <blockquote>
                “Today I have perfected for you your religion and completed My favor upon you and have approved for you Islam as your religion.”
            </blockquote>
            <p>This verse was revealed before the Prophet’s passing, indicating that Islam was already complete. If the appointment of Ali (RA) as a political leader was a fundamental part of Islam, it would have been clearly established in the Quran. The fact that there is no explicit Quranic command regarding Ali’s succession undermines the Shia claim that this was a divine necessity. If it was so important then he could have given the appointment of Ali (RA) at the event of Eid Ghadeer.</p>
            <p>Moreover, if Ali (RA) himself believed that he had been wronged in this incident, why did he never protest? Why did he cooperate with Abu Bakr (RA) and Umar (RA) in governance? Why did he marry his daughter Umm Kulthum to Umar (RA) if he considered him an enemy of Islam? The Shia narrative collapses under the weight of Ali’s (RA) own actions, which contradict the idea that he was unjustly denied leadership.</p>
            
            <h3>Conclusion: The Reality of the Calamity of Thursday</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The Prophet (ﷺ) was not prevented from writing anything. He chose not to write because Islam was already complete.</li>
                <li>There is no evidence that Umar (RA) insulted the Prophet (ﷺ)—this is a misrepresentation of the hadith.</li>
                <li>Ali (RA) never treated this event as an issue, proving that the Shia claim of unfair leadership change is false.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Ultimately, this event does not change the fact that Islam was perfected, and no one—not even Umar (RA) or any other companion—had the power to alter divine decree. The Shia attempt to use this hadith to justify their beliefs is built on assumptions, distortions, and omissions of key historical facts.</p>

            <h2>Incident of Fatima’s (RA) House</h2>
            
            <h3>1. No Authentic Sunni Reports Support This Incident</h3>
            <p>The narration that claims Umar (RA) threatened to burn down the house comes from weak and disconnected (munqati') sources.
            </p>
            <p>The main report traces back to Aslam, a freed slave of Umar (RA), who was not present during the event. Since he did not witness it himself, his report is considered weak and unreliable.
            </p>
            <p>Furthermore, many reliable Hadith scholars do not include this story in their collections because it does not meet the standards of authenticity.
            </p>
            
            <h3>2. Logical Inconsistencies in the Shia Narrative</h3>
            <p>Ali (RA) was known for his bravery. If such an attack on his wife had truly occurred, how could he have remained silent?</p>
            <p>Ali (RA) was known for his bravery. If such an attack on his wife had truly occurred, how could he have remained silent?
            </p>
            <p>According to Shia sources themselves, Ali (RA) did not retaliate. This means they either believe he was too weak to protect his wife, which contradicts his courageous character, or that the incident never happened.
            </p>
            
            <h3>3. Respect Between Umar (RA) and Ali’s (RA) Family</h3>
            <p>If Umar (RA) had attacked Fatima (RA) and caused her death, why would Ali (RA) later give his daughter, Umm Kulthum, in marriage to Umar (RA)?
            </p>
            <p>This proves that no hostility existed between Ali (RA) and Umar (RA). Their relationship was built on mutual respect and Islamic brotherhood.
            </p>
            
            <h3>4. Shia Sources Contradict Themselves</h3>
            <p>Shia historians claim that Fatima (RA) died as a result of this attack.
            </p>
            <p>However, other Shia sources also state that she lived for months after the Prophet’s ﷺ passing, which means the alleged injuries could not have been fatal.
            </p>
            <p>This contradiction weakens their argument further.
            </p>


            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The claim that Umar (RA) attacked the house of Fatima (RA) and caused her miscarriage is not supported by authentic Sunni sources.
            </p>
            <p>It is logically inconsistent, as Ali (RA) would never have stayed silent if such a thing had happened.
            </p>
            <p>The respect and love between Umar (RA) and the family of Ali (RA), including the marriage of Umm Kulthum to Umar, disprove the narrative of enmity.
            </p>
            <p>Sunni Islam holds Fatima (RA), Ali (RA), Abu Bakr (RA), and Umar (RA) in the highest regard, believing that they worked together for the unity of Islam.

        <h2>Dissagreement between Abu Bakr (RA) and Fatima (RA) </h2>
            
        <h3>Shia Perspective:</h3>
        <p>Shia Muslims believe that Abu Bakr (RA) wrongfully denied Fatima (RA) her rightful inheritance, specifically the land of Fadak, which they claim was gifted to her by the Prophet ﷺ.<p></p>
            <p>
            <p>They refer to narrations where Fatima (RA) became upset with Abu Bakr (RA) and allegedly refused to speak to him until her passing.
            </p>
            <p>Some Shia scholars argue that this incident reflects a betrayal of Ahlul Bayt.</p>
            <h3>Sunni Perspective:</h3>
            <p>Sunni scholars emphasize that Abu Bakr (RA) acted based on the hadith of the Prophet ﷺ:
                "We (Prophets) do not leave inheritance. What we leave behind is charity." (Sahih Bukhari, 6725; Sahih Muslim, 1758)</p>
            <p>According to this narration, Fadak was not personal property, but rather it belonged to the state and was used for public welfare.
            </p>
            <p>While it is acknowledged that Fatima (RA) was upset at first, Sunni sources indicate that she later reconciled with Abu Bakr (RA) before her death.
            </p>
            <h3>Proof of the Reconciliation</h3>
            <p>Ibn Kathir Confirmation: "Fatima (RA) later accepted Abu Bakr’s (RA) explanation and was reconciled with him before her death."
                (Al-Bidaya wa’l-Nihaya, Vol. 5, Page 252)
            </p>
            <p>"When Fatima was about to pass away, she made a will that Abu Bakr (RA) should perform the funeral prayer for her."
                (Sunan Al-Kubra by Al-Bayhaqi, Vol. 6, Page 300)</p>
            <p>"When Fatima (RA) became ill, Abu Bakr (RA) came and sought permission to visit her. Ali (RA) said, ‘Fatima! Abu Bakr is here asking permission to see you.’ She said, ‘Do you want me to allow him?’ Ali (RA) replied, ‘Yes.’ So, she permitted him to enter. He entered and pleased her by speaking to her and she became content with him."
                (Al-Mustadrak Ala Al-Sahihayn, Hadith 4736, Authenticated by Al-Hakim & Al-Dhahabi)</p>



                <div id="Ghadeer" class="section"></div>
                <h3>Ghadir Khumm: A Defense of Ali (RA), Not a Divine Appointment</h3>
                <p>The event of Ghadir Khumm is one of the most discussed moments in Islamic history, particularly in relation to the leadership of Ali ibn Abi Talib (RA). While some interpret it as a divine appointment of Ali (RA) as the Prophet Muhammad's (ﷺ) successor, a closer examination of historical context and evidence suggests otherwise. The event was a defense of Ali (RA) against criticism, not an announcement of his leadership. Several key points support this conclusion.</p>
                <p>Firstly, the context of Ghadir Khumm must be understood. Ali (RA) had been sent to govern Yemen, and some companions expressed dissatisfaction with his leadership. The Prophet (ﷺ) stopped at Ghadir Khumm to address this issue and reaffirm Ali’s (RA) status as a loyal and virtuous companion. His famous statement, “Man kuntu mawlahu, fa-ʿAliyyun mawlahu” (Whoever I am his Mawla, Ali is also his Mawla), was meant to emphasize Ali’s (RA) position as a close associate and protector, not as a designated ruler of the Muslim community.</p>
                <p>The term Mawla itself has multiple meanings, including friend, protector, and ally. It does not necessarily mean leader or political successor. If the Prophet (ﷺ) had intended to appoint Ali (RA) as his immediate successor, clearer terminology such as Khalifa (Caliph) or Imam would have been used. Moreover, if Ghadir Khumm was meant as a declaration of succession, the Prophet (ﷺ) would have commanded the companions to pledge allegiance to Ali (RA), as was done when Abu Bakr (RA) was later chosen as Caliph.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, the reaction of the companions is crucial evidence against the claim of divine appointment. None of the senior companions, including Abu Bakr (RA), Umar (RA), and Uthman (RA), understood Ghadir Khumm as a political declaration. Ali (RA) himself did not invoke this event when leadership disputes arose after the Prophet’s (ﷺ) passing. If this had been a divine mandate, it would have been the strongest argument in Ali’s (RA) favor, yet he never used it to challenge Abu Bakr’s (RA) Caliphate.</p>
                <p>Another point to consider is that the Prophet (ﷺ) did not appoint a successor in his final sermon during Hajj, an event attended by the largest number of Muslims. If he intended to establish a clear line of succession, this would have been the most appropriate moment. Additionally, the Quranic verse often linked to Ghadir Khumm, “Today I have perfected your religion for you…” (Quran 5:3), was actually revealed on the Day of Arafah, not at Ghadir Khumm. This verse signifies the completion of Islamic legislation rather than the appointment of a leader.</p>
                <p>Historical patterns also suggest that Ghadir Khumm was not an unprecedented event. The Prophet (ﷺ) publicly defended other companions when they faced criticism. For instance, during the Incident of Ifk, when Aisha (RA) was falsely accused, the Prophet (ﷺ) defended her and declared her innocence. Similarly, he said about Fatima (RA), “Whoever angers Fatima, angers me.” These statements were meant to protect the dignity of his close family and companions, not to assign leadership roles.</p>
                <p>Additionally, leadership in Islam was left to Shura (consultation), as demonstrated by the election of Abu Bakr (RA) through consensus. If the Prophet (ﷺ) had divinely appointed a successor, there would have been no need for consultation among the Sahaba. Everyone at the event of Saqifah would have stood up Fur Ali (RA) but clearly people did not interpret this event as a divine appointment. Additionally, major Sunni Hadith collections such as Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim do not interpret Ghadir Khumm as an appointment of Ali (RA) as the next Caliph.</p>
                <p>Lastly, the circumstances of the event itself contradict the notion of a major leadership announcement. Ghadir Khumm was a temporary stop on the journey back to Medina, not a central gathering place like Mecca or Medina, where official declarations were typically made. If this were a pivotal moment in Islamic leadership, it would have been emphasized more frequently in Islamic history.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, while Ghadir Khumm was an important event highlighting the virtues of Ali (RA), it was not a declaration of his succession. The Prophet (ﷺ) sought to defend Ali’s (RA) reputation rather than impose him as a leader over the Muslim community. The evidence from historical context, the linguistic meaning of Mawla, the lack of pledge of allegiance, the actions of the Sahaba, and the absence of explicit instructions all point to the same conclusion: Ghadir Khumm was not a divine appointment of a successor, but a reaffirmation of Ali’s (RA) honor and position among the believers.</p>

                <h2>Battle of Jamal & Criticism of Aisha (RA)</h3>
                <h3>Initial Peace Agreement:</h2>
                <p>Imam Ali (RA) and Aisha (RA)'s camps negotiated peacefully and agreed to resolve the issues without conflict.</p>
                <p>Both sides recognized the need to address the murder of Caliph Uthman (RA) through dialogue, not war.</p>
                <h3>Role of the Khawarij & Uthman's Assassins:</h2>
                <p>The group responsible for Uthman’s killing (some Khawarij and rebels) feared that if peace was established, they would be punished for their crime.</p>
                <p>This group deliberately sabotaged the peace talks by launching a surprise attack on Aisha’s camp at night.</p>
                <h3>Confusion and Start of the Battle:</h2>
                <p>Aisha’s supporters thought Imam Ali’s army betrayed them and retaliated.</p>
                <p>Imam Ali’s (RA) army, thinking they were being attacked first, responded, leading to a full-scale battle.</p>
                <p>The battle happened due to miscommunication and deceit, not because Ali (RA) and Aisha (RA) wanted war.</p>
                <h3>Sunni Perspective:</h2>
                <p>Both Imam Ali (RA) and Aisha (RA) sought peace.</p>
                <p>A third-party group (the Khawarij or Uthman’s killers) manipulated the situation to avoid punishment.</p>
                <p>The battle was not due to personal rivalry but rather the tragic result of external instigation and confusion.</p>
